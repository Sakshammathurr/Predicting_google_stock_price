Predicting Google stock prices using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Note that stock prices are influenced by many external factors such as market trends, news, political events, and global economic conditions, which are difficult to capture using only historical data. Therefore, the accuracy of the predicted stock prices may vary depending on the quality and completeness of the dataset and the model's ability to generalize to new and unseen data.
Predicting stock prices using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) can be a challenging task, as stock prices tend to be very volatile and can be affected by a wide range of factors. However, using a long time-series dataset can provide valuable insights into the trends and patterns of the stock price movements.
